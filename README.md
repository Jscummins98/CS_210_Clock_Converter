# CS_210_Clock_Converter

The program begins by asking the user to enter an hour, minute, and second values that are used to initialize a clock in 24-hour format. The program then presents a menu to the user allowing them to increment any of the three values by 1. After incrementing, the program displays the updated clock and presents the menu again. This loop continues until the user selects the "quit" option from the menu, which ends the program.
